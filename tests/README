====================
 SL unit test suite
====================

This package contains a collection of individual source files that can
be processed via ``slt`` to check that the SL compiler works properly.

Configuration
=============

To configure the unit test suite, use the following commands::

   ./configure
   make

Running the test suite
======================

The test suite is run with the following command::

   make check -jN

where N is the number of cores on the system (parallel checks). This
automates the execution of ``slt`` over all test programs.

If ``make check`` reports that a test fails, then after a fix is
installed it is possible to re-check only the failed test(s) with the
following command::

   make recheck -jN

Alternatively, a more verbose output can be obtained with the
following commands::

   make slt-check

However this does not support ``-jN``.

Licensing
